#Basic Arithmetic Operations
#Problem: Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs addition,
#subtraction, multiplication, and division. Print the results.

a = 10
b = 5
#a = int(input("Enter a number:"))
#b = int(input("Enter a number:"))

Add = a + b
print('Addition of two numbers', Add)

Substract = a - b
print('Substraction of two numbers', Substract)

Multiply = a * b
print('Multiplication of two numbers', Multiply)

Division = a / b
print('Division of two numbers', Division)
